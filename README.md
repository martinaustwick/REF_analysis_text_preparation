# REF_analysis_text_preparation
Python code used for pulling together REF Impact text into one location, cleaning out sections, and pushing to an Iramuteq-friendly format.

Code is in a Jupyter notebook, prepped in Canopy 1.7. You will need an internet connection to run this code, as it accesses the REF API.

I've not versioned the individual files, but there is a text file for the whole REF Impact output - "Impact Summary" and "Impact Details" only, with asterisked details of the UKPRN, ID, UoA, etc.
